## Usage

### Required
```bash

### Example Commands

Top 10 overall projects:
```bash
python script.py --file scores.csv --overall --count 10
```

Export everything to separate `.txt` files:
```bash
python script.py --file scores.csv --exportall
```

Export a single merged list:
```bash
python script.py --file scores.csv --tolist
```
